c-book-solutions My own solutions to the project exercises in K. N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach" (2nd edition).

Please do note that some of the project exercises in the book ask the reader only to modify a program already in the book. Such exercises have their respective directories marked by the presence of "(modified)" in their names.
